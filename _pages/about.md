# Hello World!

I don't like chaos but I have a chaotic mind. My enthusiasm for all kinds of projects makes me jump from one project to another. This leaves me feeling overwhelmed sometimes. In those cases, planning helps! 

When planning, writing or studying a new concept, you are trying to create connections. Seeing the connection between information helps clarify. When I understand a concept I can let it go. When I started to understand the field of Machine Learing, I noticed that it is actually trying to do the same! 

During an exchange semester in Moscow, Russia, I got to take a class in Cognitive Neuroscience. (Actually, I accidently stepped into the wrong classroom and found it rude to leave.) In this class, we studied the theory behind how our brains pay attention to and process information. 

The value of information is an important concept in economics. It is one of the assumptions of the free markets by Adam Smith. In the current Information Age, we can see large effects of the availability of open information on economic markets. How this will reshape society, is a large interest of mine and something I like to write about.

So, the processing of information is an essential part of our daily lives.
