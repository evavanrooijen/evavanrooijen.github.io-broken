# Project Food
This project contains several steps.

1. First, we collect data through scraping websites
2. Second, we transform the columns to appropriate dtypes, check for NaN and outliers
3. Third, we check if the sample is not overrepresenting either carbs, proteins, fats
4. Fourth, we introduce the model
5. Fifth, we apply it to breakfast
6. Finally, we deploy it through a webapp
